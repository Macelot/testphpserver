this class allows you to list apache server settings, PHP settings and interact with the MySQL database. Test tables can be created with the Tables.sql file code. The file createUser.php registers 100 users for testing. The file clearUsers.php clears the tblUser table. The testDataBase file lets you explore the database and check all tables and fields. Finally the testServer.php file performs a series of tests on the server, such file is recommended and self explanatory. Enjoy it.
